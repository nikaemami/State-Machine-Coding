Design and implement a Moore and Mealy 10010 detector in SystemVerilog

a. SystemVerilog description of a Moore machine that detects the 10010 sequence, using an asynchronous reset and the positive edge of the clock.
   Importing the Moore design in Quartus and building a symbol for it. Next, I instantiate the pre and post synthesis descriptions of the Moore machine in    a SystemVerilog testbench and compare the timing of the two descriptions.
   
b. SystemVerilog description of a Mealy machine that detects the 10010 sequence, using an asynchronous reset and the positive edge of the clock.
   Importing the Mealy design in Quartus and building a symbol for it. Next, I instantiate the pre and post synthesis descriptions of the Mealy machine in    a SystemVerilog testbench and compare the timing of the two descriptions.
   
c.   In a SystemVerilog testbench I instantiated the post-synthesis Moore and post-synthesis Mealy machines and ra   n simulations to verify                    their operations and their differences.
