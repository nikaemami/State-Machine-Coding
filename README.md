Design and implement a Moore and Mealy 10010 detector in SystemVerilog

a. SystemVerilog description of a Moore machine that detects the 10010 sequence, using an asynchronous reset and the positive edge of the clock.
   Also, I used a SystemVerilog testbench in the ModelSim simulation environment to simulate the circuit.
   
b. SystemVerilog description of a Mealy machine that detects the 10010 sequence, using an asynchronous reset and the positive edge of the clock.
